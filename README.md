## Introduction

RFM Analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on their transaction history. It stands for:
- **Recency:** How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency:** How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary:** How much money a customer spends on purchases.

This project aims to segment customers using RFM Analysis, allowing for more targeted marketing efforts.

## Data

The dataset used for this project includes the following fields:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `OrderID`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `PurchaseDate`: Date when the purchase was made.
- `TransactionAmount`: Amount spent on the transaction.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**
    - Converted the `PurchaseDate` field to datetime format.
    - Calculated the `Recency` by subtracting the purchase date from the current date.

2. **Calculation of RFM Metrics:**
    - **Recency:** Days since the last purchase.
    - **Frequency:** Number of purchases made by the customer.
    - **Monetary:** Total amount spent by the customer.

3. **Scoring & Segmentation:**
    - Assigned scores for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
    - Combined the scores to create an overall RFM score.
    - Segmented customers into groups based on their RFM score.

4. **Visualizations:**
    - Created various visualizations to understand the distribution of customer segments and their purchasing behavior.

## Visualizations

- **Bar Chart:** Distribution of RFM value segments.
- **Treemap:** RFM customer segments by value.
- **Box Plot:** Distribution of RFM values within the Champions segment.
- **Heatmap:** Correlation matrix of RFM values within the Champions segment.
- **Comparison Bar Chart:** RFM segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores.

## Usage

To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `plotly`).
3. Place your data in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script to perform RFM Analysis and generate visualizations.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of RFM Analysis in understanding customer behavior and segmenting them for targeted marketing strategies. The insights gained can help in designing campaigns that enhance customer engagement and drive revenue growth.
